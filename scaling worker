Scaling workers can happen in the form of:
1. Adding/Removing servers to/from the cluster.
2. Starting/Stopping workers on a single server.
3. Adding/Removing resources to/from a single server

- We'll also need to make sure all the servers are using the same queue
connection that communicates with the same queue storage driver. For
example; if we have two servers running workers that consume jobs from
the database queue connection, we need to make sure both servers are
connected to the same database instance.

- Scaling on a Fixed Schedule
If we know exactly when we need to add more workers and when they are
no longer needed, we can use CRON to start a supervisor process group on
a fixed schedule and stop it when the workers are no longer needed.
