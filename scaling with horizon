- Scaling out means adding more workers, scaling in means
removing workers. Adding/Removing workers (or servers) is called
Horizontal Scaling. Increasing/Decreasing resources of a single server is called Vertical Scaling.

processor
- Horizon decides the number of workers to allocate based on the expected
time to clear per queue. So if the jobs in the deployments queue take more
time to run while jobs in the notifications queue run instantly, even if the
notifications queue has more jobs than the deployments queue, Horizon
will still allocate more workers to the deployments queue since it has the
higher time-to-clear
