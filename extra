Adding More vCPUs
Using a Shared vCPU
Shared vCPUs are a good option for low to medium workloads with
occasional bursts for brief periods of time. They are cheaper than machines
that come with dedicated vCPUs so I recommend you start with this option
if you're not sure yet about what you need.
Choosing the Right Amount of RAM
For example; if you are caching values in a static array or a property of a
singleton, you should clean that cache when you're done:
// Storing items in a static array.
SomeClass::$property[] = $item;
// Flushing the cache when we're done.
SomeClass::$property = [];
To prevent this, Laravel limits the memory consumption to 128MB for each
worker process. You can change the limit by using the --memory option:
php artisan queue:work --memory=256
Warning: That worker-level limit should be lower than the
memory_limit set in your php.ini file.
