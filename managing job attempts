- When one of your workers picks up a certain job from the queue, Laravel counts it as an attempt. Even if the job didn't run at all, it's still considered
an attempt. For that reason, you may want to allow your jobs to be
attempted multiple times before you consider it a failure

- Your worker fails to download the job payload due to a networking
issue. The worker crashes while unserializing the payload.
The job timeouts.An unhandled exception was thrown from inside the job.The worker fails to mark the job as processed due to networking
issues.

- for handle exception use backoff technique

- retry after if worker failure Make sure retry_after is longer than your longest-running job to prevent the job from becoming available again while another worker is still processing a previous attempt.

-rety until

-  If you configure a long job expiration with an unlimited
number of tries, you should consider setting a reasonable backoff so
the job doesn't keep popping up in your queue and keeping it busy.

- max exception
