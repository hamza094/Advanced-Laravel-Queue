One of the most popular tools is Supervisor, which can be easily installed on
any UNIX-like operating system:
- Supervisor Configurations
- Starting Workers
- Stopping Workers
- Restarting Workers
- Avoiding Memory Leaks
With that being said, avoiding memory leaks can still be a bit challenging.
Over time, some references will pile up in the server memory that won't be
detected by PHP and will cause the server to crash at some point.
The solution is easy though, restart the workers more often.
f you don't want to use a CRON task, you can use the --max-jobs and --max time options to limit the number of jobs the worker may process or the time
it should stay up:
php artisan queue:work --max-jobs=1000 --max-time=3600
